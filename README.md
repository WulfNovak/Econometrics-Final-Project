# Econometrics-Final-Project
Econometric analysis of Education's effect on employment status.
Control variables such as Age, Sex, Marital Status, School, and State are included.

* The code is annotated and should be intuitive to go through. 
Variables are modified and relabeled. This is annotated in the code. 

Both A linear Probability Model and Logit Model are used. 

Limitations occurred when attempting to incorporate heteroskedastic errors to the Logit Model. 
Also, when model output included state name instead of FIPS code p-values were dramatically altered. 

In the future STATA will be used when working with economic data because it is easier to 
model and compensate for heteroskedastic errors.
